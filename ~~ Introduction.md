## Introduction

### Introduction

- This book is designed to prepare readers for the RHCSA EX200 exam on RHEL 9.
- It is not intended as a beginner’s guide to Linux. Readers are expected to have some prior Linux experience.
- The RHCSA exam is performance-based. It requires demonstrating practical system administration skills in a live environment.
- Readers must actively perform tasks, not just read passively.
- The book encourages hands-on practice through:
  - Direct, clear explanations of concepts.
  - Tasks provided after each conceptual explanation to ensure practical application.
- Readers are expected to repeat exercises until proficient.
- The goal is not memorization, but mastery through action.
- Success on the exam depends on familiarity with real-world scenarios and the ability to execute tasks accurately under time pressure.

### Goals and Methods

- The RHCSA exam tests practical, task-based skills rather than theory.
- This book mirrors the exam’s hands-on structure by offering step-by-step tasks and exercises.
- Readers are expected to:
  - Perform each task manually.
  - Repeat tasks until they can be completed quickly and without error.
- This repetition develops speed and precision — essential for a timed, performance-based exam.
- Tasks are structured to build muscle memory for real-world administration.

  - A companion website: https://rhatcert.com
  - Includes:
    - Additional practice exams
    - Appendix materials
    - Video-based training
